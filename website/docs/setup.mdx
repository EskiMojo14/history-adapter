# Setup

A "history adapter" for managing undoable (and redoable) state changes with [immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/), which pairs well with state management solutions like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction).

Also includes a Redux specific version, with additional utilities for use with Redux Toolkit.

import PatchesTabs from "/src/components/PatchesTabs";
import RTKCounter from "/src/components/RTKCounter";

<PatchesTabs>
  <RTKCounter />
</PatchesTabs>

## Installation

Install with your package manager of choice:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" default>
    ```bash
    
    npm install history-adapter

    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">
    ```bash

    yarn add history-adapter

    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bun">
    ```bash

    bun add history-adapter

    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage

The main export of `history-adapter` is the `createHistoryAdapter` function. This function takes an optional configuration object and returns an object with useful methods for managing undoable state changes.

For a list of all available methods, see the [API reference](/category/api).

By default, history entries will be a copy of state before/after each change. However, you can use `createPatchHistoryAdapter` to store JSON Patches instead.

### Configuration

The `createHistoryAdapter` function accepts an optional configuration object with some of the following properties:

- `limit` (number): The maximum number of history entries to store.
  - If not provided, all history entries will be stored.
